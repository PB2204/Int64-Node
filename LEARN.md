## What is int64-node?

**int64-node** is a JavaScript library that provides support for handling 64-bit integer numbers in Node.js. JavaScript's native Numbers are represented as IEEE 754 double-precision floats, which have limited precision for values beyond Â±2^53. This library aims to provide a performant and Number-like class for carrying and manipulating 64-bit integer values.

## Why Use int64-node?

JavaScript's native Number type has limitations when it comes to accurately representing 64-bit integers. int64-node offers the following benefits:

- **Precise 64-bit Integers:** int64-node allows you to work with 64-bit integers with full precision, avoiding loss of accuracy for large numbers.

- **Ease of Use:** Int64 instances in int64-node look and feel like JavaScript Numbers, making it easy to integrate into your projects.

- **Compatibility:** int64-node is designed to work seamlessly with Node.js applications, making it a suitable choice for server-side projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with int64-node, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install int64-node
```

Once installed, you can create Int64 instances and perform various operations with them.

## Usage Examples

Here are some basic usage examples to help you get started with int64-node:

```javascript
// Require the int64-node module
const Int64 = require('int64-node');

// Create Int64 instances
const int1 = new Int64(0x12345678, 0x9abcdef0);
const int2 = new Int64('123456789abcdef0');

// Perform arithmetic operations
const result1 = int1 + 1; // 4886718346
const result2 = int2 + 1; // Infinity

// Convert to different representations
const octetString1 = int1.toOctetString(); // '0000000123456789'
const binaryString1 = int1.toString(2); // '100100011010001010110011110001001'
```
